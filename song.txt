Ever since I was a kid, I been legit (Jit, ooh, nah)
If I was you, I would cut up my wrist (Dumb bit')
XO tatted all over her body, yeah (Yeah)
She just wanna roll and I don't mind it, yeah
Ever since I was a jit, I been legit (Ooh, nah, uh)
You should let her go, she wanna be it (Oh, yeah)
Double-O tatted on her body, yeah
It don't matter what they say, I'm timeless, yeah (Schyeah)
